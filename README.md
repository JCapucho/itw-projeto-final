# Projeto Final de ITW 2022

Este é o repositório desenvolvido para o projeto final da unidade curricular de
introdução as tecnologias web, desenvolvido por João Capucho e Carolina Silva.

Built with:
- [Bootstrap v5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/)
- [Font Awesome v4.7](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/)

## Developing

A convenience development server is provided, that can be started by running:

```
$ npm install # Install dependencies (only needs to be run once)
$ npm start   # Start the development server
```

The development server watches for file changes and updates the browser when the
underlying file changes.

All development files are contained inside the `src` directory.

### Integration with VSCode

This workflow is integrated with vs code, a task file is provided making it easy
to start the development server from vs code, simply open the quick open menu
(`Ctrl+P`) type `task` and a space and select the `start` task.

Another way is to open the command pallete (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and open 
`Tasks: Run task` and select the `start` task.
